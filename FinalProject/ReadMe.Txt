Here is my final project.  I cleaned up the Underwater Hockey Website.

I had some issues with valid HTML and CSS, so I sacrificed some errors for a better looking page because I could not get around some of the errors.

My JavaScript componenent is the LightBox that can be seen on the "Meet the Team" page.

I implemented some responsive design by using media queries and min-width properties.

My site can be seen at msuuwh.com
