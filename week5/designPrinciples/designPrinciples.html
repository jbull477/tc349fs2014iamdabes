<h1>Design Principles</h1>

<h2>80/20 Rule</h2>
<h3>Good</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit:</a>  80% of the content on the website comes from 20% of the users.</p>
<h3>Bad</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.fckerbeck.com/">F.C. Kerbeck:</a>  The content is so disorganized that the 20% will have trouble using 80% of the website.</p>

<h2>Hick's Law</h2>
<h3>Good</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.usaa.com">USAA:</a>  The dropdowns on the website have headings inside of the dropdown to show categories so the users can easily select the content for them.</p>
<h3>Bad</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.dsrny.com/">DSR NY:</a>  The content on the homepage could be listed in a much more simple way and is unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<h2>Chunking</h2>
<h3>Good</h3>
<p><a href="http://absolutepunk.net/">AbsolutePunk:</a>  The content is in bite sized pieces.  Each story is in the same format so the user knows when that story ends and the next begins.</p>
<h3>Bad</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.arvanitakis.com/">Arvanitakis:</a>  There is so much going on within the page that I cannot even process what is happening.</p>

<h2>Ockham's Razor</h2>
<h3>Good</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com">Google:</a>  The simple design shows the user exactly what they need to see and nothing more.</p>
<h3>Bad</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/">The Worlds Worst Website Ever:</a>  The design is extremely complicated and everything on the page could be done in a much more elegant way.</p>

<h2>Mapping</h2>
<h3>Good</h3>
<p><a href="http://msuuwh.com/">Michigan State University Underwater Hockey:</a>  Each part of the menu is only used for one function, getting to that specific page.</p>
<h3>Bad</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pulcinella.ca/">Pulcinella:</a>  None of the pages are mapped well.  The user never knows what will appear unless they hover over the arrow and then click it.</p>
